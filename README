GORM kernel - user branch
===========

GUI Operating System kernel written in C++ With 64-bit
Long Mode support and SMP support.

You need a copy of a cross compiler (g++) alongside binutils.
The bootloader is made in house. This copy also comes with
DJGPP as we support the COFF format.

We support the ext2, alongside a variant of COFF.
